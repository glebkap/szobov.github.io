## Background

As I've mentioned in previous [article]({% post_url 2018-12-24-try-to-avoid-using-usb3.0-and-2.4hz-radio-like-gps %}), my team works on UAV project, also from time to time we do a trials on a wild nature.
Because of our company located on a north, in a quite cold climatic zone, we often have a different problems, related to extreme weather condition.

I've decided to mention here a list of this problems and advice how to avoid or mitigate it. May be I'll update this article it there are will be more.
