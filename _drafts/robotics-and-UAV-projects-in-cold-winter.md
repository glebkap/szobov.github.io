## Background

As I've mentioned in previous [article]({% post_url 2018-12-24-try-to-avoid-using-usb3.0-and-2.4hz-radio-like-gps %}), my team works on UAV project, also from time to time we do a trials on a wild nature.
Because of our company located on a north, in a quite cold climatic zone, we often have a different problems, related to extreme weather condition.

I've decided to mention here a list of this problems and advice how to avoid or mitigate it. May be I'll update this article it there are will be more. I understand that it's maybe obvious, but you'll work in the similar conditions it might help.

## Sub zero

There are many troubles, related to negative temperature:

### Hardware

Unfortunately, not all hardware is ready to work in extreme conditions. For example onboard computers, like [ODROID-XU4](https://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?t=20864) by specification can operate only in a range 0째C .. +70째C, ...
[oCam-1MGN-U Plus](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/ocam-1mgn-u-plus-1mp-usb3-0-mono-global-shutter/) operating temperature also 0째C .. +70째C.
